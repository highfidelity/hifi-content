## Description

The Money Tree is a scripted entity that uses Assignment Client and Client-based scripts to allow users of High Fidelity to randomly gift one another small amounts of HFC.  At random intervals the tree randomly selects a user within the zone to be the "giver" and 2 or 3 other users to be potential recipients of HFC from the giver.  The giver can choose to select (or not) one of the potential recipients identified by a floating coin over their head.  On selection of a recipient, that recipient has one minute to acknowledge and accept their gift or lose out.  Money Tree gifts are processed by the bank of High Fidelity up to 24 hours after receiving a gift.  All HFC is distributed by the bank, users are not giving away their own money.

The Money Tree is a way to promote positive social exchanges, community growth, and grow the High Fidelity economy.

## TO DO LIST
1.  Buzz the recipient's controllers to alert them more sharply to acknowledge their gift.
