# Scale Avatar

Use the hand controllers to scale your avatar.

Run scaleAvatar.js script in High Fidelity client via "Edit" > "Running Scripts...".

In VR, when you hold down both grips and both triggers, your avatar can scale itself: 
- Moving hands away from eachother will scale your avatar larger 
- Moving hands together will scale your avatar smaller
