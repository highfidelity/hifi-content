### Description

"Last Avatar Standing" is a Trivia game for High Fidelity.  A host controls the game and poses questions to players.  Players answer the questions by choosing 1 of 4 colored squares to stand on that represents their choice.  After 10 seconds, players standing on the wrong square are removed from the board via teleportation.  Points are winner take all, with the balance at the beginning of a game set to the number of players x 100 (minimum of 300).  If no one is correct for a given round, the prize is cut in half and everyone stays on the board.  As long as someone is right, the prize increases by 100 points each round.
