# Keyboard

This blueprint item was created by the High Fidelity Experiences Team as a template to be copied and modified by our users. 

The code is heavily commented for clarity and by following this README, users will learn more about creating using the High Fidelity API. We encourage people to create their own variations of this and other blueprint items.

The keyboard can be played in both HMD and desktop by most avatars. The keyboard is played by clicking keys via mouse, touching keys with fingers, or hitting the keys with other objects thatt have collisions enabled. Keys will play classic piano sounds and change to a random color upon being pressed.
