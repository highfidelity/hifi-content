This basic app is intended to help users who cannot use their microphone or as a quick visual aid during 
conversation. It allows you to draw lines with the index finger of your dominant hand in HMD using the trigger 
or in desktop via mouse clicks. The lines will disappear after 60 seconds unless erased in HMD mode using the 
grip. You will need to close your tablet to draw.
