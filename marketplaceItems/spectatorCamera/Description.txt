Are you a **livestreamer, YouTuber, or creative type** who enjoys making videos? Try out Spectator Camera!

Using the Spectator Camera tablet app, you can spawn a virtual camera whose viewpoint shows up on your monitor. Use the Camera with OBS Studio to record and stream your High Fidelity adventures.

You can also use your hand controller to take a snapshot with the Spectator Camera - it's like a virtual selfie stick without all of the silly limitations of physics!

Last but not least - use Spectator Camera to take a 360 photo! 360 Photos taken with Spectator Camera can be shared on Facebook, [Kuula](https://kuula.co/), [Veer](https://veer.tv/), and other sites. They can also be used as skyboxes for your domain.

**Changelog:**

v2.6 (2019-07-09)

- Fixed a hack in which the secondary camera feed was darkened to compensate for it being rendered too light.
- If your camera looks too light, it means you have an older version of Interface (pre PR #15862) and should go back to the previous version of this script.
- If your camera looks too dark, it means you have a newer version of Interface (post PR #15682) and should update to the current version of this script.

v2.5 (2019-06-27)

- We've moved the code for this project into a new remote folder, which necessitated a version bump. There are no changes to functionality.

- Fixed the wiring of a couple signal handlers to prevent erroneous EventBridge messaging
