With User Inspector, you can click anywhere on an avatar and get a quick view of who they are with a few advantages:

1. Always see the same size nametag no matter how far away you are.
2. Define the size yourself through the custom app.
3. If you are an admin, you will see their username
4. If their display name changes, you will see the update.
5. If they are your friend, they will become a brighter color, and you can also see their username. 
6. The nametags won't ever get culled by avatars or the environment.

**Changelog:**

V2.0 (2019-04)
- Fixed culling by using the render layer in front
- Updated colors to make them easier to read

v1.0 (2019-03)

- Initial Release

Known Issues:
- V1.0 is a stop-gap version.  Created in RC79, but RC79.1 broke some local text entity properties this relied upon. They will be fixed in RC81.  The current rendering issues weren't worth fixing for one release.  In that release, the render layer will be in front, and you will always be able to see the name tags without being culled.
