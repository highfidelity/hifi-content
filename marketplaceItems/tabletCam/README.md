## Changelog

### v2.2 (2019-07-09)

- Fixed a hack in which the secondary camera feed was darkened to compensate for it being rendered too light.
- If your camera looks too light, it means you have an older version of Interface (pre PR #15862) and should go back to the previous version of this script.
- If your camera looks too dark, it means you have a newer version of Interface (post PR #15682) and should update to the current version of this script.

### v2.1 (2019-06-27)

- We've moved the code for this project into a new remote folder, which necessitated a version bump. There are no changes to functionality.

### v2.0 (2019-04)

**I've made some huge changes in v2.0!**

- In Desktop mode, when using the rear-facing camera and while you're using Third Person Camera, Tablet Cam will now be parented to Interface's Third Person Camera!
- The camera's viewpoint can now be detached from its default position! Snap a photo from a unique viewpoint.
- Fixed a bug that caused zoom settings to be saved incorrectly between restarts.
- Fixed a bug that caused the camera preview to show up as a corrupted image in HMD mode.
- Fixed a bug that caused the position of the rear-facing camera to be incorrect in HMD mode.
- Switched Overlay usage to Local Entities.
- Now you can use Tablet Cam in Desktop mode while "Desktop Tablet becomes Toolbar" is unchecked - although I'm not sure why you'd want to do that. :)
- Fixed some interface bugs.

### v1.1 (2019-02)

- Fixed a bug that caused Tablet Cam to erroneously appear on the Tablet after switching domains when it was previously active.

### Tablet Cam v1.0 (2019-01)

- Tablet Cam v1.0 is an update to Selfie Cam v1.0. It is a complete overhaul of the app. All of its features are new!

### Selfie Cam v1.0 (2018-12)
