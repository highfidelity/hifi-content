# Party-Ball!

## Description
First we gave you the dance, now we give you the beat! (and some nice visuals on the side)

Party ball is just what it sounds like.  It's a ball.  It's a party.  It's a party ball, yall.

As soon as the first person grabs or clicks on the ball, a random timer starts so you never know when the party is going to happen.  The last person who grabs it before the party begins is the main attraction.  

You are then treated to a particle and light show that is different every time you set the party ball off.  

So why the party ball?

A) It's fun.  Like...real fun.
2) It features 25 original sons by Milad(MEOWlad)
III) You can play musical hot potato.  Or in this caes MEOWsical hot potato
four) It's a perfect opportunity to teach you about how to make cool entities like this on the High Fidelity platform.
