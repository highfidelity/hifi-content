# PARTY BALL

No party happening in Hifi?  Well don't just stand there like an L7-Zero when you can be the Hifi-Hero!

#_PARTY BALL!_
 
Grab the ball.  Throw the ball.  Party Ball.  It's a party in the ball.  
Stop making me say things and just party with this ball.

You don't know how long it will last.  
You don't know when it will happen.  
The only thing you know is that it will be a unique party each time.

# EACH TIME!

How else to use this ball?  As a musical hot potato of course.  
The last person to touch the ball gets to be the dancer.  

Does that mean they are the winner or the loser?  

# YOU DECIDE!

It's yo ball.  
Do what you gonna do.  
We can't tell you, 
Who to party ball to.
